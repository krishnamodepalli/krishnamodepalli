# KRISHNA MODEPALLI

***Hola Amigo's,*** ðŸ˜œ  
I am @[krishnamodepalli](https://github.com/krishnamodepalli/). I am a B.Tech CS student of ANITS, Vizag, India.

I may be an amateur in coding or whatever field this is, But I strongly feel that I can do anything, Just because I'm curious in this thing.  
I'm just a beginner here, But I'm sure someday I'll make something **BIG**.
